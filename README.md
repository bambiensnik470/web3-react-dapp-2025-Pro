## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how modern, user-centric dApps interact with the traditional financial system (CeFi).

Let's break down how `web3-react-dapp` (or any similar dApp framework) would integrate with major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

### The Core Challenge: Two Different Worlds

First, it's crucial to understand that `web3-react` is a library for connecting to **decentralized** networks (like Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) via wallets like MetaMask. Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) are, by definition, **centralized** and operate off-chain with their own private order books and accounts.

**`web3-react-dapp` cannot directly interact with CEXs.** There is no "Connect to Binance" button in MetaMask. Therefore, integration happens **indirectly** through a critical intermediary: the **Exchange API**.

Here is a visual representation of this architecture:
